# MonkeCosmetics
> Working version of old CustomCosmetics mod for G-Tag written from scratch

## B-0.1 Plans
> For the first "Release" we just want to add Material support

## How to add assets?
> For now building assetbundles and putting it in the same directory as the Dll with the file extention `.MCmat`, This will load *all* of the Materials inside
