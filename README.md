# MonkeCosmetics
This mod is a sort of rewrite of the original cosmetics mod known as Gorilla Cosmetics.

This is not intergrated with the wardrobe currently but in the future that may be a possiblity.

## B-0.1 Plans
For the first "Release" there will only be material support as it's easy to integrate. 

Hat support will most likely come in the full 1.0 release or earlier.

## How to add assets?
For now building assetbundles and putting it in the same directory as the Dll with the file extention `.MCmat`, This will load *all* of the Materials inside.

Eventually we will switch to a whole different schema but for now this works.
