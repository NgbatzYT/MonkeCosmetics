# MonkeCosmetics
This mod is a sort of rewrite of the original cosmetics mod known as Gorilla Cosmetics.

This works with the original GorillaCosmetics `.material`/`.gmat` files.
They will be loaded in but compatibility can't be guaranteed.

This is not intergrated with the wardrobe currently but in the future that may be a possiblity.



## How to add assets?
For now building assetbundles and putting it in the same directory as the Dll with the file extention `.MCmat`, This will load *all* of the Materials inside.

Eventually we will switch to a whole different schema but for now this works.

For GorillaCosmetics just put the `.material`/`.gmat` files into the plugins folder and they will load.
